# Email-Fraud-Detection
Utilizing the Enron Emails to create a Fraud Detection model.


## Why does this matter?
Enron was one of the largest energy companies in the world before it's collapse in 2001.  Not only was it the largest bankruptcy in American history at the time, it also dragged Arthur Anderson,  one of the 5 largest accountancy/audit firms, down with it.  The effects of this gigantic risk management failure are still being felt in the financial and energy markets nearly 2 decades later.  

The board was generally ignorant of what was going on at Enron, and both the guilty CEOs Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling, charmed and bullied the board and their underlings into accepting things the way they were without question.  Culture issues aside, the Enron case had a number of classic fraud 'red flags' that would have indicated something was up years before the collapse.  

Using the case as a study and example of the magnificant way some companeis can fail would benefit us in the future.  We can learn from the mistakes of the past, and better utilize the current resources to find these failures at an early stage.  Ultimately we set out to create a machine learning model that would detect individuals who may need the additional scrutiny of an analyst to review, the email sender as engaging in possible fraud.  Using AI as a first line of defense frees up the resources of the analysts to focus on investigating _warm leads_ or freeing up the human capital resources for use elsewhere in the organization.

## Source Data
The dataset we are reviewing is the remaining body of corporate emails mostly between 1997-2001. The remaining body contains data from about 150 users, mostly senior management of Enron, and contains over 500k individual emails. This data was originally made public, by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation. You can find the source data here:  https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/
